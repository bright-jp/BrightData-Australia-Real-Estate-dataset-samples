Not only will you love the fact that you live on an island, but you will also have a home on a cul de sac, and who would have thought that possible in this buzzy inner south precinct?This property is something different thanks to this wonderful location. You will have more privacy, less noise, better street parking and quicker access to the Lake Foreshore than just about any other complex not on it's own island!  My owner certainly thinks so, it's why she bought here in the first place! Sadly, circumstances decree that we must sell, and soon.  Not only do you get to live on an Island but you pretty much get to live in a penthouse too! Top floor, so no neighbours above, and only one other on your floor. From number 46 you look down onto the sparkling infinity pool, you can hear the cows grazing on the dairy flats, enjoy stunning sunsets behind the Carillion from your large balcony not to mention foreshore vistas from both bedrooms. All of this can be yours.I am assured that the balcony is so private you can confidently avoid any kind of tan line if you so desire! The living area and balcony face North East so the sun pours into your living room and means you have a terrace that you and your plants can bask on for most of the day.This elegant apartment has wrap around windows in the open plan living area, so you get fabulous views designed to be enjoyed from the luxury of your sofa. The kitchen has a fantastic work area with granite island and good storage. The balcony accommodates a BBQ, generous table an AND those important sunloungers, so the whole space is fabulous for entertaining.The cool bathroom interiors are simple, and sleek and the ensuite is generous with double sink and a good sized shower. The main bedroom has it's own private balcony which is the perfect place to snooze in the shade of a summer afternoon. Other impressive features are the wonderfully practical garbage chute (no bins for you!) and the two car parks are right next door to the lift that takes you to your front door..This is such a great opportunity if you are downsizing, or a busy executive or want to invest now and move in later. The Foreshore offers such easy living, with local restaurants offering great mid week specials you won't be bothered to cook half the time!

Both provide easy access to the nearby well-appointed bathroom and separate toilet.Perfectly positioned in the sought-after suburb of East Maitland, the property offers easy access to the growing medical precincts in surrounding areas, which include a large private hospital, a range of healthcare specialists and a new state-of-the-art regional hospital and emergency room currently under construction in the nearby suburb of Metford.Its central position also puts the best of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley within easy reach, with the tourist mecca of Morpeth and the revitalised Maitland city centre less than 10 minutes away.A 40-minute drive in opposite directions will see you enjoying the beaches and boutiques of Newcastle or sipping on a glass of wine in the world-renowned Hunter Valley vineyards, where a host of championship golf courses, fine dining restaurants and rejuvenating day spas also await.You can also relax with a whale watching cruise or enjoy the delights of Nelson Bay's D'Albora Marina in just over 50 minutes, while Sydney's wide array of attractions are just a two-hour drive down the M1 motorway.SMS 26aPat to 0428 166 755 for a link to the online property brochure.","[{""comapny_link"":""https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/river-realty-maitland-RIBMOR?cid={cid}"",""company_adress"":""7 Church Street, MAITLAND, NSW 2320"",""company_name"":""River Realty - Maitland"",""link"":""https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/chad-buckley-2245918?cid={cid}"",""name"":""Chad Buckley"",""num_reviews"":33,""phone"":""0438184972"",""start_rating"":5},{""comapny_link"":""https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/river-realty-maitland-RIBMOR?cid={cid}"",""company_adress"":""7 Church Street, MAITLAND, NSW 2320"",""company_name"":""River Realty - Maitland"",""link"":""https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/chris-henry-113450?cid={cid}"",""name"":""Chris Henry"",""num_reviews"":10,""phone"":""0438636276"",""start_rating"":5},{""comapny_link"":""https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/river-realty-maitland-RIBMOR?cid={cid}"",""company_adress"":""7 Church Street, MAITLAND, NSW 2320"",""company_name"":""River Realty - Maitland"",""link"":null,""name"":null,""num_reviews"":577,""phone"":""02 4934 4111"",""start_rating"":5}]"," large  ",

With dual street frontages and its proximity to services, there's potential for multi-dwelling redevelopment (subject to council approval). Enjoying an elevated position, the impressive residence has large rooms and ornate character features, complemented by 3.5m ceilings, with ample opportunities for sympathetic restoration and renovation.At the front, the large master bedroom enjoys a bay window and an ensuite-effect to 1 of 2 bathrooms. An elegant lounge with an open fireplace flows into the gas-heated formal dining room, both adorned with decorative ceilings. With electric cooking appliances and a dishwasher, the large updated kitchen overlooks a tiled meals and family area, with views of the manicured backyard.

Once situated on the highest block in Strathalbyn and home of two past Strathalbyn Mayors, this lovely circa 1920s stone home offers a welcome respite to the everyday chaos of city life. The entrance of the home offers the first glimpse of the delights to follow, with a striking wrought iron door inviting access to the formal foyer and beyond. 12 foot high ceilings, dappled light, rendered archways and wide passageways are just a few of the charming features of this unique property. The main and second bedrooms are extraordinarily spacious and the third, although slightly smaller, is bright and enchanting. The living area features a slow combustion heater that warms the entire living space on those chilly winter nights, as well as a unique feature wall of arched dormer windows and a recessed feature mantle. This flows into a functional dining area, both of which are graced with bright window seat areas.  Between the kitchen and the dining areas is a heritage style butlers pantry that also houses the entrance to the underground cellar. The kitchen has been recently renovated and is expansive and bright. With a double Falcon oven and Miele dishwasher, this old stone home has been smoothly integrated into the modern era. From here you move into the Family room, which is another more recent addition to the home. There is a segregated area that functions easily as a laundry with its own access to the outdoor pergola area. The family room features double glass doors as well as a large picture window, offering light and many entertainment options. There is also another toilet hidden at the rear of this extension. The bathroom is aged, but functional, with quite a few delightful features  including unique tap ware, a deep bath, shower piping and saloon style shower doors.The expansive yard of  1757m2 is an entertainers delight, with beautifully landscaped gardens that feature a number of seating nooks and play areas for children. There is a sheltered fire pit area for those clear spring nights that simply beckon to be shared with a glass of red wine and an enclosed patio that offers an extra outdoor entertaining area from the family room at the rear of the house.  The back yard also features a double garage, garden shed, 3 enormous rain water tanks, a cubby house and sandpit, numerous established fruit trees and a vegetable garden. If this isnt enough, the garden and lawn are low maintenance, serviced by a modern watering system. Other fabulous features this unique home has to offer are its 10 kilowatt solar system, 3 phase power outlet in the rear shed, sub surface irrigation and its walking access to local shopping and schools. Although ready for its new owners to move into and live comfortably, this home also has enormous opportunity for a savvy renovator to add elements of their own personality. With only a 45-minute commute to the city, this could just be the rural retreat you have been looking for.","[{""comapny_link"":""https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/raine-horne-strathalbyn-rural-sa-XRHSTT?cid={cid}"",""company_adress"":""6 Albyn Terrace, STRATHALBYN, SA 5255"",""company_name"":""Raine & Horne - Strathalbyn | Rural SA"",""link"":null,""name"":null,""num_reviews"":253,""phone"":""08 8536 3830"",""start_rating"":5}]"," medium  ",

A rare opportunity with equal proximity to the city and sea; there are some lovely homes in upwardly-mobile Kilkenny but few to compare with this fresh 3 bedroom, 2-bathroom abode.Set on an easy-care 485m²(approx.) block, sixties sturdiness has been brilliantly recalibrated to exciting modern standards, with stunning updates throughout and a north facing entertaining pergola that sets the benchmark for seamless family luxury both indoors & out. The floor plan harmoniously separates your master bedroom suite from your two remaining bedrooms, while grouping family and kitchen spaces for that open plan feel, with better flow, as lounge, dining and kitchen spaces nurture more light and greater sociability.And nothing says ""ready for business"" like a new kitchen.  With stainless steel 750mm gas cooktop, under bench oven, dishwasher, tiled splash back, and a position overseeing the open plan family and meals area adds a modern ""yes"" to a footprint eager to live, host, and entertain.Back outside, plan your next party and watch the kids play happily on the lush lawns at the rear, the perfect space for the green thumb complimented by an array of fruit trees and a chicken run that's sure to keep the veggie garden healthy and plentiful. And should you want to venture outCharacter streets, convenient shopping and retail, local schools, McInerney Reserve within reach, transport via Torrens Road, a 10-minute spin to Croydon or Bowden's cafe scene, and merely 8kms to the CBD.And a few extrasUpdated gas feedUpdated wiring & electrical boardRoller shutters to front windowsGleaming timber floorboardsR/C Split system air cond.Gabled pergola & raised timber deckNew laundry and an abundance of storageCarport with auto roller door leads to lock up garageFruit trees - Olive, lemon, peach, fig, plum, apricot, mandarin and nectarines*We make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy, reliability or completeness of the information relating to the property.

imagine the lifestyle and gracious living offered by this fine example of elegance and true craftsmanship.Transvaal is one of those tightly held homes that grabs the heart and becomes more of a love affair, which is exactly why our vendors are only the third owners ever since the home was built in 1919.Builder Ernest Clephane was highly respected around Launceston in the late 1800's and some of his works included The Albert Hall, Duck Reach Power Station, The Majestic Theatre in Brisbane Street (now known as The Princess Theatre), National Theatre in Charles Street, The Gasworks in Cimitiere Street and the Launceston Church Grammar School.When it came time to build his own family home he really wanted to make a statement and that's exactly what he did after he designed and constructed 21 Home Street.With tuck point brick work, beautiful leadlight windows, formal dining room, soaring 12"" ceilings, ornate fretwork and mantles, Transvaal takes all the hallmarks of federation period and blends it beautifully with modern day living.This home really must be seen to be appreciated.Call Harley for more information
